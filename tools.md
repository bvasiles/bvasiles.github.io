## GenderComputer

Python tool that tries to infer a person's gender from their name 
(mostly first name) and location (country). 
For example, *Andrea* is a first name typically used by men in Italy and women 
in Germany, while *Bogdan* is a first name typically used by men irrespective 
of the country. 
Similarly, a Russian person called *Anna Akhmatova* is more than likely a woman 
because of the *-ova* suffix.
