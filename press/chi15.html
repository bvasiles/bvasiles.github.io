<h1>Gender and tenure diversity in GitHub teams</h1>

<p><b>Having higher gender and tenure diversity is associated with higher 
productivity in <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> teams</b>.</p>
<p>A joint team of computer science researchers from 
<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu">University of California, Davis</a> and 
<a href="http://www.tue.nl/en/">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>, in The Netherlands, 
have conducted a study of the effects of  gender and tenure diversity on 
productivity and turnover in teams of Open Source Software (OSS) developers, 
and have found small but positive effects. 
The paper describing the results has been accepted for presentation at the 
prestigious <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org">2015 ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors 
in Computing Systems</a>, in Seoul, South Korea, in April 2015. 
The paper was authored by 
<a href="http://bvasiles.github.io">Bogdan Vasilescu</a>,

and <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~filkov/">Vladimir Filkov</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Vasilescu, the first author on the paper, and colleagues used regression 
modeling on carefully-extracted data from more than 23,000 projects on GitHub, 
the largest and most popular online collaborative coding platform. 
To triangulate the findings, they also ran a user survey, with more than 800 
respondents. 
Their models show that after controlling for team size and other confounds 
(such as a project's age, development model, or amount of social activity), 
both <i>gender and tenure diversity are positive and significant predictors of 
productivity</i>, together explaining a small but significant fraction of the data 
variability. 
The benefits of experience diversity have a limit, though, as higher tenure 
diversity may increase attrition. 
This negative effect appears to be mitigated, however, when more experienced 
people are present. 
Survey respondents acknowledged the importance of diversity on their team's 
functioning, but reported different perceived effects.</p>
<p>This is the first academic study to consider effects of <i>gender</i> diversity on 
productivity and turnover in OSS communities. 
Based on these findings, Prof. Filkov, the senior author on the paper, believes 
that increasing gender and tenure diversity in software teams may benefit 
productivity, if all other confounds are equal. 
Traditionally, women are significantly underrepresented in OSS and other 
technical teams. 
On a larger, economic and societal scale, these findings suggest that added 
investments in educational and professional training efforts and outreach for 
female programmers will likely result in added overall value. </p>
