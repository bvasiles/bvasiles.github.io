Hi there! I'm an Associate Professor in [CMU](http://www.cmu.edu)'s 
[School of Computer Science](http://scs.cmu.edu) and a member of the 
[Software and Societal Systems Department](http://s3d.cmu.edu).
My students and I form the [Socio-Technical Research Using Data Excavation Lab 
(STRUDEL)](https://cmustrudel.github.io).

I'm most active in the [software engineering research community](http://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2016/toyear/2023/index?soft),
where I have co-chaired the 
[MSR 2023 PC](https://conf.researchr.org/track/msr-2023/msr-2023-technical-papers),
have been serving on program committees for the major software engineering venues (including
[ICSE](https://2019.icse-conferences.org/committee/icse-2019-technical-papers-program-committee), 
[ESEC/FSE](https://esec-fse19.ut.ee/committees/research-papers/), and 
[ASE](https://2019.ase-conferences.org/committee/ase-2019-papers-program-committee);
thanks for the [Distinguished Reviewer Award](http://www.ase2018.com/?p=awards) at ASE 2018 and ESEC/FSE 2021!),
and am an Associate Editor for the [ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tosem/editorial-board#associate-editors),
<!-- and am co-chairing the [SIGSOFT Initiative on Data-driven Introspection](https://www.sigsoft.org/annualrpt/2019annualreport.html), -->
among [others](/service/).

On the internets I'm sometimes referred to as a *"[prominent female professor from 
a gender studies department, that no one ever audits and that gets to peer review 
herself](http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=6780783&cid=48866403)"*.
I also suffer from [*cognitive dissonance*](http://lemire.me/blog/2015/01/14/knauff-and-nejasmic-recommend-banning-latex/)
as a scientist who uses LaTeX.


#### Prospective Students

If you're a motivated student looking for a PhD position, check out the 
[Software Engineering](https://se-phd.isri.cmu.edu) 
and [Societal Computing](https://sc.cs.cmu.edu) programs at CMU, which most of
my [current students](https://cmustrudel.github.io/people/) are part of. 
Applications are due early/mid December. 
Please feel free to reach out to me before applying, to introduce yourself and describe 
your research interests.

**Note**: I don't always have capacity to take on new students or funding to support 
them, but don't let that preclude you from reaching out!


#### Research Experiences for Undergraduates

My favorite time of the year is summer, partly because that's when Pittsburgh stops
being a [top-5 Gloomiest Place in America](https://www.bestplaces.net/news/gloomiest-places-in-america)
for a few days, but mostly because of the [Research Experiences for Undergraduates in 
Software Engineering (REUSE) Program](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/isr/reuse/).
If you're an undergraduate student (and preferably also a U.S. citizen, national, or 
permanent resident, because of how some of the funding for the program works)
interested in summer research in interdisciplinary software engineering, please 
consider applying!
It's okay if you're a first- or second-year, or if you don't have prior research 
experience or advanced coursework in computer science or software engineering.

[Former REU students](/reu/) in the STRUDEL lab have
generally had a good experience, published papers, won awards, and went on to graduate
schools or to do other amazing things.


#### Brief Bio

Prior to joining CMU, I was a postdoc in the 
[Davis Eclectic Computational Analytics Lab (DECAL)](http://decallab.cs.ucdavis.edu)
at [UC Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu), where I worked with 
[Vladimir Filkov](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~filkov/) and
[Prem Devanbu](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/).
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science *cum laude* (and 
[cum tuxedo](https://www.tue.nl/en/news/news-overview/21-10-2014-bogdan-vasilescu-obtains-his-phd-cum-laude-in-3-years-time/))
at [Eindhoven University of Technology](http://www.tue.nl/en/), The Netherlands, 
in October 2014, under the supervision of 
[Alexander Serebrenik](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/) and 
[Mark van den Brand](http://www.win.tue.nl/~mvdbrand/).
<!-- ([here's a 10 minute video summary](http://youtu.be/-rh0IJxagHI) of my thesis). -->
My PhD work won the [Best Dissertation Award](https://ipa.win.tue.nl/?page_id=565)
from the [Institute for Programming Research and Algorithmics](http://www.win.tue.nl/ipa/).
I also hold a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from 
Eindhoven University of Technology (thesis advisor: 
[Alexander Serebrenik](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/))
and an engineer's degree in Systems and Computer Science from Romania 
([webpage](http://www.upg-ploiesti.ro) in Romanian; thesis advisor: 
[Gabriel R&#259;dulescu](http://ac.upg-ploiesti.ro/gradulescu/gradulescu.php)).
