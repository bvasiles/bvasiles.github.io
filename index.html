<p>Hi there! I'm an Assistant Professor in <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">CMU</a>'s 
<a href="http://scs.cmu.edu">School of Computer Science</a>. 
I'm a member of the <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/index.html">Institute for Software Research</a>.
</p>

<p>
Prior to joining CMU, I was a postdoc in the 
<a href="http://decallab.cs.ucdavis.edu">Davis Eclectic Computational Analytics Lab (DECAL)</a>
at <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu">UC Davis</a>, where I worked with 
<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~filkov/">Vladimir Filkov</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/">Prem Devanbu</a>.
<br>
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science 
<a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/news/21-10-2014-bogdan-vasilescu-obtains-his-phd-cum-laude-in-3-years-time/">
<i>cum laude</i></a> at 
<a href="http://www.tue.nl/en/">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>, The Netherlands, 
in October 2014, under the supervision of 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/">Alexander Serebrenik</a> and 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~mvdbrand/">Mark van den Brand</a> 
(<a href="http://youtu.be/-rh0IJxagHI">here's a 10 minute video summary</a> 
of my thesis).
My PhD work won the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/news/03-06-2015-bogdan-vasilescu-wins-ipa-dissertation-award/"><i>Best Dissertation Award</i></a> 
from the <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/ipa/">Institute for Programming Research and Algorithmics</a>.
<br>
I also hold a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from 
Eindhoven University of Technology (thesis advisor: 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/">Alexander Serebrenik</a>)
and an engineer's degree in Systems and Computer Science from University of Ploie&#351;ti, 
Romania (<a href="http://www.upg-ploiesti.ro">webpage</a> in Romanian; 
thesis advisor: <a href="http://ac.upg-ploiesti.ro/gradulescu/gradulescu.php">Gabriel R&#259;dulescu</a>).
</p>

<p>On the internets I'm known as a 
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=6780783&cid=48866403">
<i>prominent female professor from a gender studies department, that no one 
ever audits and that gets to peer review herself</i></a>.
I also suffer from <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/2015/01/14/knauff-and-nejasmic-recommend-banning-latex/">
<i>cognitive dissonance</i></a>.

<h4>Research</h4>

<p><i>Software is being developed by increasingly distributed and increasingly 
diverse groups of individuals</i>. 
How can we empower distributed teams to develop software effectively and 
productively? How can technology help software teams do more with less? 
What effects does team composition have on productivity and code quality?</p>

<p>I am engaged in <i>interdisciplinary research</i> to offer <i>data-driven 
answers</i> to these questions. 
My work draws from <i>empirical software engineering</i>, <i>social computing</i>, 
and <i>computer-supported cooperative work</i>. 
I collect <i>Big Data</i> from open source software, which are widely used and, 
with the advent of social coding platforms like <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, 
extremely popular. 
I analyze these data using <i>mixed research methods</i> from computer science 
and the social sciences (e.g., statistical analysis, grounded theory) to develop 
or validate theories about software engineering processes and outcomes.

my work and a few representative research projects.

<b>Projects:</b>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/projects#scalingup">Scaling up distributed software development</a></b></li>
The pull-based model made popular by GitHub aims to speed up and scale up 
distributed software development. Owing to this model, developers have a great 
many projects to choose from, and integrators have increasingly higher review loads.
	<ul>
	<li><a href="/projects#onboarding">Socialization is a precursor to developers joining a new project</a></li>
	<li><a href="/projects#ci">Continuous Integration speeds up the pull request process</a></li>
	</ul>

<li><b><a href="/projects#diversity">Diversity in distributed software teams</a></b></li>
Due to largely meritocratic hiring, software teams can be quite diverse, e.g., 
with respect to gender, cultural background, and programming language preference. 
However, women are still underrepresented in programming. 
On social coding platforms, the situation is even worse.

<!-- 
<p>I'm interested in purposeful collaborations, such as those in 
<a href="http://github.com">open source software development</a>.
It's fascinating how such collaborations succeed, despite people participating 
in them being so different: typically they are a mixture of volunteers and 
professionals, they come from a mixture of cultural and educational backgrounds, 
they have different interests and expertise, and they are geographically 
distributed all over the world.
And while most of the previous work in this area has considered these people 
to be equal, in <a href="/publications">my research</a> I focus on exactly this 
diversity: how differences between participants in a single community, and 
differences between communities, relate to individual-level and community-level 
outcomes.
</p>
<p>I often find myself mining repositories, using metrics, and performing all 
kinds of statistical analyses. 
As a hobby I'm also interested in computational geometry and algorithmic problems.</p>
