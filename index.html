  <p>Since November 2014 I am a postdoctoral researcher in the 
<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu">CS</a>
department at UC Davis, working with 
<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~filkov/">Vladimir Filkov</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/">Prem Devanbu</a>.</p>
<p>I obtained my PhD <i>cum laude</i> at 
<a href="http://www.tue.nl/en/">Eindhoven University of Technology</a> in October 2014,
under the supervision of 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/">Alexander Serebrenik</a> and 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~mvdbrand/">Mark van den Brand</a>.
<a href="http://youtu.be/-rh0IJxagHI">Here's</a> a 10 minute video summary of my thesis.
In July 2011 I obtained my Master's degree <i>cum laude</i> also at the TU/e, 
under the supervision of 
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/">Alexander Serebrenik</a>.
Prior to that I did my undergrad studies in Romania.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I'm very interested in purposeful collaborations, such as those in open source.
It's fascinating to see how such collaborations succeed, despite people 
participating in them being so different: typically they are a mixture of 
volunteers and professionals, they come from a mixture of cultural and 
educational backgrounds, they are interested in, motivated by, and good at 
different things, and they are geographically distributed all over the world.
And while most of the previous work in this area has considered these people 
to be equal, <a href="publications.html">my work</a> focuses on exactly this diversity: 
how differences between participants in a single community, or differences 
between communities, relate to individual-level and community-level outcomes.</p>
<p>I often find myself mining repositories, using metrics, and performing all kinds 
of statistical analyses. 
As a hobby I'm also interested in all kinds of computational geometry and 
algorithmic problems.</p>
