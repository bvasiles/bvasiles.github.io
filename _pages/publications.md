Before I started requiring that my students produce large amounts of text in the form
of theses to graduate, others have done the same to me!
Here are those artifacts:
- PhD thesis (2014): [*Social Aspects of Collaboration in Online Software Communities*](https://doi.org/10.6100/IR780923). 
Eindhoven University of Technology. 
<!--  -->
- MSc thesis (2011): [*Analysis of Advanced Aggregation Techniques for Software Metrics*](https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/analysis-of-advanced-aggregation-techniques-for-software-metrics).
Eindhoven University of Technology. 

All other publications are on the [STRUDEL page](https://cmustrudel.github.io/publications/).
