My [STRUDEL](https://cmustrudel.github.io) students and I are engaged in 
mixed-methods interdisciplinary empirical research at the intersection of 
*software engineering*, *social computing*, and *computer-supported cooperative work*. 

Recently, much of our work has focused on **improving the sustainability of open-source software**. 
Open source plays critical roles in our software infrastructure, and by extension 
in economic growth and almost every facet of modern life, far beyond only technical 
software projects: it is used in almost every product or in the process of creating 
products by companies big and small, often in ways invisible to open-source maintainers 
or without ever contributing back. 
Some argue that open source provides just as important infrastructure as 
[roads and bridges](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/) 
do for the economy.
However, despite its ubiquitousness, the importance of open-source software, and our 
dependence on it, are often not recognized.
Sustaining open source remains a significant challenge. 

Our research takes a broad view of software development as an inextricable *socio-technical 
activity*, which leads to a multi-dimensional approach to our work: 
contributing to *understanding and improving the organization, functioning, and overall 
health of open-source communities*, on the more social side, but also to *understanding 
and developing tooling to help software developers overcome specific technical challenges*, 
on the more technical side.

#### Highlights

- This [3-minute video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFarCOdKOaQ) of our
data-driven approach to studying open-source teams.
- This [infographic](https://cmustrudel.github.io/badges) summarizing a recent research 
project on the use of repository badges within the npm ecosystem.
- This [keynote talk](https://portal.klewel.com/watch/webcast/scala-days-2019/talk/33/) 
I gave at the 2019 Scala Days about sustaining open source digital infrastructure.
